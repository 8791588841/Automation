# Automation
This project focus on building a machine learning workflow that will run autonomously with the CSV file and return the best-performing model.

We have used XGBoost, LogisticRegression, KNN and SVM. 

 It contains an Jupyter Notebook file(.ipynb) and an html file to view the code in any browser.
